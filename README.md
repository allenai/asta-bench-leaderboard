## Development
The leaderboard is built using the [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) library, which provides a convenient way to manage and query datasets.
It's currently pointed at the [AstaBench Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/asta-bench-internal-results/) dataset, which is a public dataset hosted on HuggingFace.

To run the leaderboard locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
This will start a local server that you can access in your web browser at `http://localhost:7860`.

## Hugging Face Integration
